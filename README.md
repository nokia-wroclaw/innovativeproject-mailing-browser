**If you want to set it up locally:**
**Before setting up the project please equip yourself with elasticsearch client. You can download it for free at https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch Install it and launch.**
**Please download the repository by typing commands:**
```
git clone https://github.com/nokia-wroclaw/innovativeproject-mailing-browser.git
```
**Then you need to install all node modules required by the app by running:**
```
cd Frontend/
npm install

**Now you have to change lines 6-9 in the backend/mailbox_connect.js this way:**
```
var client = new elasticsearch.Client({
